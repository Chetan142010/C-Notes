Loop in C++

**Loops in C++ are used to execute a block of code repeatedly until a certain condition is met. They help in manage repetitive tasks.

1.for loop: Used when the number of iterations is known beforehand.

2.while loop: Used when the number of iterations is not known and dependent on a condition.

3.do-while loop: Similar to the while loop, but guarantees that the block of code will be executed at least once before checking the condition.
