Constructors in C++
A constructor is a special function in a class that is automatically called when an object is created.
It is used to initialize the  data members of the class.
It has the same name as the class and no return type.
We use constructors to initialize objects automatically when they are created, so we don't have to set values manually each time.

Types of constructors:

1. Default Constructor - No arguments, sets default values.
    Ex: null represents the intentional absence of any object value
 
2. Parameterized Constructor - Takes arguments to set specific values.

3. Copy Constructor - Create a copy of another object.
